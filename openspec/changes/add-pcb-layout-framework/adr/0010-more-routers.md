# ADR 0010: TopoR, OrthoRoute, and topola as further routers

**Status:** Accepted (2026-09-07)
**RFC:** 11 §3.8, §4.1, §8.2, §9.2

Asked after B4: wrap TopoR and OrthoRoute and benchmark them. Each was evaluated on the reference machine (Linux, KiCad 10.0.4, RTX 3050 with CUDA available, Python 3.10, cargo present but no Rust toolchain installed, 2 GB of disk free) on 7 September 2026. One is wrapped, one cannot be, one waits on a toolchain.

## router-orthoroute: wrapped, and not a two-layer router

`bbenchoff/OrthoRoute` 1.0.0 at `dbc4bc6` (MIT), a GPU Manhattan-lattice PathFinder router that ships as a KiCad IPC plugin. Its `.ORP` and `.ORS` files are documented JSON (gzip on disk), so the wrapper writes the ORP from the IR and reads the ORS back without the KiCad GUI or the IPC server: `python main.py headless <board>.ORP -o <out>.ORS --max-iterations N --cpu-only`. CuPy is optional (the code falls back to numpy); `strategy.gpu: true` asks for CUDA. Checkout at `bench/var/tools/orthoroute`, interpreter at `bench/var/tools/or-venv` (numpy, scipy, psutil), overrides `COPPERHEAD_ORTHOROUTE` and `COPPERHEAD_ORTHOROUTE_PYTHON`.

What the runs showed:

- **It routes laterally on inner layers only.** `unified_pathfinder.py`: "Lateral routing layers: inner layers only (outer layers are reserved" for pad escapes, and an emit guard refuses any planar segment on an outer layer. On a two-layer board it therefore cannot route a single net: a hand-made two-net ORP came back with 0 of 2 routed after every iteration ("0 H / 0 V internal layers"), and the golden `completion` board came back as eight pad-escape stubs on F.Cu and five vias, no net finished. The same two nets on a four-layer stack routed on In1.Cu with vias at once. The README says as much ("not a general-purpose PCB autorouter", "extremely large, dense, highly regular multilayer backplanes").
- **The manifest declares it:** `capabilities.minLayers: 4`, a new field; the registry refuses the engine with "needs at least 4 copper layers, board has 2" before anything runs. `copperbench` on the 15 golden microboards with only this router: 13 UNSUPPORTED with that reason, 2 REFUSE (the seeded placement faults), 0.1 s per board.
- **On a four-layer variant of `completion`** (the golden board with In1.Cu and In2.Cu added) the wrapper returns copper, and the verifier rejects it: completion 0 %, 58 DRC errors, one short; on the four-layer `congestion` nothing routed. Its 0.4 mm lattice knows pad centres, not pad shapes or the outline, which is fine for a backplane and not for a 26 mm board. Freerouting on the same four-layer `completion` reports 0 unrouted by its own count, yet the verifier reads 17 %: the harness's four-layer path (SES import through export and connectivity) is untested and outside this change's two-layer scope. That is where four-layer support starts, not in another router.

Decision: registered, fail-closed, never offered a two-layer board. It is the right engine to have on the roster for the day a backplane arrives, and the benchmark number for the corpus this change is about is "not eligible".

## TopoR: cannot be wrapped

Eremex's topological router is the yardstick for two-layer results, and it imports DSN and exports SES. It is a Windows application; the free Lite edition runs under Wine, Linux support is "planned", and there is no documented command-line or batch mode. A fail-closed wrapper needs a headless invocation with an exit code and an output file; a GUI under Wine driven by input injection is not one, and this machine has no Wine and no sudo. Not registered. If Eremex ships a CLI or a Linux build, it rides the Freerouting DSN/SES bridge like Freerouting does.

## topola: waits on a toolchain

`topola/topola` (MIT, Rust; GitHub mirror `mikwielgus/topola` at `666e06c`, 2 July 2026) is the only other headless DSN-to-SES autorouter found: `topola <in.dsn> [-o out.ses]` loads a Specctra design, runs a planar autoroute on layer 0 for every pin, and writes the session. It is a work in progress: the CLI routes one layer with no vias, so on a two-layer board it can at best route what fits on F.Cu. Checkout at `bench/var/tools/topola`; `cargo build --release -p topola-cli` stopped at "rustup could not choose a version of cargo" because no toolchain is installed, and installing one (about 600 MB) at 2 GB free was not done unasked. The wrapper is a manifest and a small adapter over `emitDsn` and `parseSes` (the port's SES scale must be checked: PR #253 found a DSN router writing raw micrometres under Freerouting's resolution header).

## What this leaves

For the two-layer, under-50-component boards RFC 11 §13.5 targets, Freerouting remains the only wrapped router that completes boards, kicad-tools the second opinion, and the ceiling is still set by the engine, not the harness. The tough-board probe run alongside (`bench/suites/pcbench-large.json`, the seven permissive DRC-clean PCBench boards of 50 to 123 footprints) says the same: one routed clean (HellScribe), three ended PARTIAL on shorts and clearance, and three were refused by a checker false positive the larger boards exposed (KiCad 4-era "VIA" footprints, one pad and no courtyard, under a part's courtyard), fixed in this change: a single-pad footprint with no courtyard no longer takes part in courtyard overlap, which is what KiCad's DRC does.
