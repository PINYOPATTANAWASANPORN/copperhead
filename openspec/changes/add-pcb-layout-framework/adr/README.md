# Decision records for add-pcb-layout-framework

One file per decision RFC 11 leaves to the implementation (its Appendix C.2 and the §3.8 standing rule: before any new algorithm, record which §4.1 neighbour was evaluated and why it was not adopted or wrapped). Each record carries the evidence it rests on, gathered on 5 September 2026 on the reference machine (KiCad 10.0.4, Node 24, Python 3.10 and 3.14), so a later reader can tell a verified fact from a default.
